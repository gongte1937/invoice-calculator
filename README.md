## Deployment Strategy

### Frontend Hosting

- **Static asset hosting** on a global CDN such as **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **AWS Amplify Hosting** provides low-latency delivery for the Next.js build output.
- Configure automatic builds on pushes to the main branch and enable cache invalidation to keep assets up to date.

### Backend Deployment on AWS

- Package the Quarkus service into a container image and deploy it to **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)** on **Fargate** for managed compute, or alternatively to **Elastic Beanstalk** for simplified provisioning.
- Store container images in **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** and use **Application Load Balancer** to route HTTPS traffic to backend tasks across multiple Availability Zones for resilience.

### Security Measures

- Enforce **TLS termination** at the load balancer and redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Manage secrets (API keys, database credentials) with **AWS Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store**, granting access through fine-grained IAM roles attached to compute tasks.
- Restrict network access with **security groups** and, if necessary, private subnets with **NAT gateways** for outbound traffic.

### Scalability and Cost Considerations

- Configure **auto scaling policies** on ECS services based on CPU/memory utilization or request metrics to handle variable load.
- Use multi-stage environments (dev/staging/prod) with right-sized task counts and on-demand scaling to control spend.
- Monitor utilization via **Amazon CloudWatch** and set budgets/alerts to avoid cost overruns.

### Infrastructure as Code

- Automate provisioning with tools such as **Terraform** or **AWS CDK** to version-control infrastructure, enable repeatable deployments, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
- Reuse modules/stacks for networking, ECS services, and load balancers to promote consistency across environments.
